# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock
A alternate take on the classic version of rock, paper, scissors popularized in an episode of the Big Bang Theory. 
The addition of two extra variables are said to reduce the chance of tie games leading to a tie and increasing the chance of a victory condition. 

I am toying with the idea of adding an additional mechanic, sort of deal with the devil option, selecting that object would guarantee a victory point,
but if the user chooses to test fate, a computation will take place and on the odds that the computer also selects the object or some other form of randomization 
the computer will get two victory points, this alternate victory condition would only be allowed once per game. I still neeed to flush out the mechanics of how
I want it to work or even if it will award or revoke points.
